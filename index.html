      <h2>In Memoriam:</h2>
      <h3>During a covert mission into the Soulless' operations, The Chaos Crew tragically lost one of its founding members: The minotaur druid, Paul.</h3>
      <p>He was potentially the last of his kind. He knew the risks involved with carrying out the mission and made the ultimate sacrifice in order to dispatch GÃ¼nther Finnipaldi, a high-ranking officer of The Soulless. He is dearly missed, and the crew holds out hope that he is resting easy somewhere in a field of flowers and wildlife. </p>
